# Project Document — AI Tank Locator App

1. **One-Sentence Summary**  
An AI-powered mobile app that uses satellite imagery, property records, and machine learning to pinpoint exact locations of hidden septic tanks for service providers, transforming hours of searching into predictable 15-minute jobs.

2. **Idea Description**  
SepticSleuth is a SaaS platform that revolutionizes how septic service providers locate buried septic systems. Instead of wasting hours with metal detectors and guesswork, service providers can upload an address and instantly receive GPS coordinates, photos, and depth estimates. The app combines public records, satellite data, and crowdsourced tank locations with computer vision to spot telltale signs in aerial photos—manholes, inspection ports, concrete rectangles. As technicians log new discoveries, the database grows, creating network effects that make predictions more accurate for everyone. The platform targets a massive market of over 21 million homes with septic systems, offering subscription tiers from $49-$250 per month based on territory size and features. Within 18 months, the goal is to become the definitive septic system map for entire regions, opening enterprise opportunities with municipalities, insurance companies, and real estate platforms.

3. **Target Audience**  
- Primary: Septic service providers and contractors who waste hours locating buried tanks
- Secondary: Small construction firms and septic maintenance companies
- Tertiary: DIY homeowners seeking septic system information
- Enterprise: Municipalities, insurance companies doing property assessments, and real estate platforms

4. **Problem Summary**  
Septic service providers face severe pain points when locating buried septic tanks. They waste hours hunting for hidden systems using metal detectors and guesswork, often digging random holes and showing up unprepared to job sites. This inefficiency costs time, money, and customer satisfaction. With over 21 million homes having septic systems in the US alone, the problem scales across a massive market. Contractors frequently share "war stories" about impossible-to-find tanks in Facebook groups and Reddit threads, demonstrating widespread frustration with current methods.

5. **Solution Summary**  
SepticSleuth eliminates the treasure hunt by providing instant, AI-powered location data. Service providers upload an address and receive GPS coordinates, photos, and depth estimates before crews leave the shop. The solution combines multiple data sources: public property records, satellite imagery analysis using computer vision to detect visual indicators (manholes, inspection ports, concrete rectangles), and crowdsourced data from technicians who log new discoveries. The platform uses machine learning that improves with each successful location, creating data network effects. As the database grows, predictions become more accurate for all users, establishing SepticSleuth as the definitive regional septic system map.
